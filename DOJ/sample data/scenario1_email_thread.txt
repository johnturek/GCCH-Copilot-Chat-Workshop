Subject: RE: Priority Discovery Productions - Case 28-CR-00178 Brady Material Issue

Ms. Williams,

Case 28-CR-00178 (USA v. Martinez - drug trafficking) has potential Brady material requiring immediate review. During FBI 302 review, I identified:
- Confidential informant reliability issues (failed polygraph in unrelated case)
- Inconsistent statements by CI across three debriefings
- DEA payment records showing $45,000 paid to CI over 18 months

I flagged this for Brady review per Criminal Resource Manual 165. However, the case agent indicates the CI credibility issues were from 2025 and resolved. Defense counsel has filed a motion for early Brady production (filed March 18).

Should we:
1. Produce the CI materials by March 22 deadline as Brady?
2. Request AUSA review before producing?
3. File motion for in camera review with the Court?

Also, case 28-CR-00156 (wire fraud trial) has voluminous bank records. FBI provided 12,000 pages of financial documents. Defense requested organized Bates-stamped production with privilege log. Estimated completion: March 21, which meets our deadline but is cutting it close.

Question: For the wire fraud case, defense counsel requested forensic accountant discovery. Is this required under Rule 16(a)(1)(E) as expert witness disclosure?

Respectfully,
David Chen, GS-9

Subject: RE: Priority Discovery Productions - Guidance and Approvals

Criminal Division Team,

After reviewing the cases with the U.S. Attorney:

1. Case 28-CR-00178 (Martinez drug trafficking): APPROVED for Brady production by March 22. Produce CI materials with redacted informant identity per sealed Court order. Coordinate with DEA on protective order requirements. This is exculpatory material under Brady v. Maryland - we have constitutional obligation.

2. Case 28-CR-00156 (wire fraud): APPROVED for organized production with Bates stamps. Prioritize financial records linked to fraud counts in indictment. Expert witness disclosure required under Rule 16 - provide summary of accountant's expected testimony by March 22.

3. All productions must include Jencks Act review per Criminal Resource Manual 620 - hold witness statements until after direct testimony, but identify in discovery log.

David - Work with FBI case agent on accelerated Brady review for Martinez case. Coordinate protective order with defense counsel. Copy me on the status update by COB today.

Maria - Send me update on the bank robbery and identity theft cases by noon. We need to ensure no delays given the detention hearing timeline for Johnson.

Also, reminder: District received notice of increased discovery motions due to recent Supreme Court ruling on Brady obligations. We need to explore options for additional paralegal resources. Sarah, let's discuss case management in our 1400 meeting today.

Well done on managing the discovery obligations during this busy trial calendar.
