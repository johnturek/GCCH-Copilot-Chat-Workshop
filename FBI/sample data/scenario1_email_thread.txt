Subject: Priority CT Leads - Week of March 18-22 - Action Required

Team,

Per DIOG Section 5.5, we have several priority counterterrorism leads requiring immediate attention this week. The workload must be distributed efficiently to meet operational deadlines.

Priority Leads (Investigative action deadline: March 22, 2028, 1700 local time):
- Case #272A-WF-4567: Suspected homegrown violent extremist (HVE) - social media threat indicators requiring follow-up
- Case #272A-WF-4589: International terrorism subject - potential travel to conflict zone requiring urgent assessment
- Case #272A-WF-4601: Material support investigation - financial transaction analysis needed before source meeting
- Case #272A-WF-4623: Joint Terrorism Task Force referral - interagency coordination required for surveillance operation

Sarah - You're assigned cases 272A-WF-4567 and 272A-WF-4589. Please prioritize threat assessment and database checks.
Carlos - Handle cases 272A-WF-4601 and 272A-WF-4623. Coordinate with JTTF partners and Financial Analysis Section.

All leads require:
- Guardian database entries and updates
- Completed threat assessment matrices
- JTTF notification if applicable
- Supporting intelligence products and source documentation

Timeline is critical due to the upcoming intelligence community briefing on March 25. Any operational conflicts or resource needs, contact me immediately.

Subject: RE: Priority CT Leads - Case 272A-WF-4589 Intelligence Gap

SSA Johnson,

Case 272A-WF-4589 (international terrorism subject) has incomplete intelligence reporting. The subject, HASSAN, Mohammad, has known travel patterns to Turkey but missing:
- Complete financial transaction history (bank records from 2027-2028)
- Full social network analysis (associates identified but not fully vetted)
- Travel documentation analysis (passport stamps require translation and verification)

I contacted our Legal Attaché in Ankara requesting records by COB March 20. However, they indicated difficulty obtaining bank records until March 23 due to foreign government processing requirements and legal review.

Should we:
1. Schedule threat assessment briefing for March 23 (after intelligence gaps filled)?
2. Request expedited liaison channel through State Department?
3. Proceed with preliminary threat assessment using available information?

Also, case 272A-WF-4567 (HVE subject) has a database name-check delay. The subject has a common name flagging multiple FBI and IC database matches. Estimated resolution: March 21, which meets our deadline but is cutting it close for the tasking.

Question: For the HVE case, the JTTF requested expedited physical surveillance approval. Is this eligible under our immediate threat criteria, or do we need FBIHQ approval?

Respectfully,
Sarah Williams, GS-11
Intelligence Analyst

Subject: RE: Priority CT Leads - Operational Guidance and Approvals

CT Squad,

After reviewing the leads with SAC and coordinating with FBIHQ Counterterrorism Division:

1. Case 272A-WF-4589 (HASSAN international terrorism): APPROVED for March 26 threat assessment briefing. Proceed with preliminary assessment using available intelligence. Legal Attaché coordination continues for complete financial records. Prioritize travel pattern analysis and associate network mapping.

2. Case 272A-WF-4567 (HVE subject): APPROVED for expedited physical surveillance under immediate threat authority per DIOG 18.3. This qualifies under operational priority given social media threat indicators. Coordinate with JTTF partners and schedule surveillance for March 22 pending database resolution.

3. All leads must include enhanced vetting per recent FBIHQ operational memo 28-CT-012345 - additional scrutiny on foreign contacts and financial patterns.

Sarah - Work with Intelligence Division on accelerated database query resolution for the HVE case. Copy me on the intelligence product by COB today.

Carlos - Send me update on the material support and JTTF referral cases by noon. We need to ensure no operational delays given the interagency coordination requirements.

Also, reminder: Squad received tasking for increased lead coverage due to elevated threat environment. We need to explore options for additional analyst and agent resources. Michael, let's discuss squad workload allocation in our 1400 operational meeting today.

Well done on managing the operational tempo during this critical period.
