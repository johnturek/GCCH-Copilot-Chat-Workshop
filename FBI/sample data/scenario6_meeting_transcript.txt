AGENDA ITEM 1: CYBER THREAT PRIORITIES - Q2 2028

Director Henderson: Good morning, everyone. Let's begin with cyber threat priorities for the quarter. Robert, please start with the current threat landscape.

AD Kim (Cyber Division): Director, we're tracking three major threat developments. First, ransomware-as-a-service operations have increased 300% in Q1 compared to last year. We're seeing critical infrastructure targeting - healthcare, energy, and financial sectors being hit hardest.

Second, nation-state APT groups are escalating intrusion attempts against defense contractors and government networks. CISA reports elevated threat levels, and we're coordinating on attribution and disruption operations.

Third, business email compromise continues evolving with AI-enhanced social engineering. We're seeing deepfake voice technology used in C-suite impersonation attacks, resulting in over $2.1 billion in losses last year.

Deputy Director Chang: On the ransomware question - how does this impact our resource allocation across field offices?

AD Kim (Cyber Division): Sir, it's creating significant strain. Field office cyber squads are at 85% authorized strength due to hiring challenges. We have agent vacancies impacting operational tempo, and our digital forensic examiners are backlogged 120 days on average.

We have a critical decision point coming up - the FY2029 budget submission in April. We need to justify additional cyber resources, but we're competing against other priority programs.

Director Henderson: What's our recommendation on prioritization?

AD Kim (Cyber Division): Director, I recommend we emphasize ransomware disruption and child exploitation as top tier priorities. These have the highest victim impact and strongest public safety nexus. Use operational wins in these areas to build Congressional support for additional cyber resources.

AGENDA ITEM 2: COUNTERTERRORISM OPERATIONS AND RESOURCE CHALLENGES

AD Johnson (Counterterrorism): Director, our counterterrorism division is facing significant threat volume increases. We're processing 15% more terrorism-related leads than last quarter - primarily homegrown violent extremist (HVE) indicators and international terrorism travel concerns.

Current Joint Terrorism Task Force coordination is stretched thin with 47 active investigations requiring multi-agency support. This is drawing concerns from partner agencies about resource allocation. We've received feedback from three major JTTFs expressing concern about FBI capacity to support complex operations.

Deputy Director Chang: What's driving the operational strain? Staffing or intelligence gaps?

AD Johnson (Counterterrorism): Both, sir. We're down multiple Special Agents due to training cycles at Quantico and temporary duty assignments. Additionally, new intelligence vetting procedures for source operations are adding approximately 8 days per lead for approval processing.

AD Williams (Criminal Investigative): We've submitted hiring requests to expand counterterrorism squads, but HR hasn't approved the positions yet given Bureau-wide hiring constraints. In the interim, I recommend we explore cross-division support - temporary details from other investigative programs for high-priority CT operations.

Director Henderson: Approved. Sarah, coordinate with David and Mark on personnel logistics. Also, I want a strategic communication plan addressing partner agency concerns while explaining our resource prioritization. Lisa, work with Sarah on interagency messaging to manage expectations and maintain partnerships.

AGENDA ITEM 3: INTELLIGENCE PRIORITIES AND ASSESSMENT

AD Thompson (Intelligence Branch): Director, the intelligence landscape shows several critical developments:

First, increased foreign intelligence activity targeting FBI operations and personnel. Counterintelligence Division reports elevated hostile intelligence service interest in our cyber and counterterrorism programs. No successful penetrations, but we recommend heightened operational security awareness, especially for sensitive investigations.

Second, intelligence collection gaps continue affecting major case investigations. We need enhanced technical collection authorities and improved coordination with Intelligence Community partners. The upcoming NCIJTF conference in April provides an opportunity to address these gaps.

Third, we've seen concerning patterns in insider threat indicators - nothing actionable yet, but establishing enhanced monitoring protocols with Security Division.

Director Henderson: Are we confident in our intelligence posture for supporting high-priority operations?

AD Thompson (Intelligence Branch): Yes, Director. We've conducted strategic intelligence reviews with NSA and CIA. Our collection and analysis capabilities are solid for current priorities. Recommend we focus intelligence resources on top-tier threats - ransomware attribution, nation-state cyber actors, and HVE identification - while maintaining baseline coverage of other threat areas.

AGENDA ITEM 4: PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS

AD Thompson (Office of Public Affairs): Director, we've had a productive quarter on public engagement and transparency. Key highlights:

Our social media engagement with public increased 23% - particularly strong performance on cyber safety awareness and victim assistance content. The Director's recent remarks at the cybersecurity conference generated significant positive media coverage.

However, we're also tracking concerning Congressional scrutiny trends. Multiple oversight committees are requesting information on FBI investigative authorities and civil liberties protections. We're working with Congressional Affairs to provide responsive information, but it's resource-intensive and requires careful legal review.

Looking ahead, we have opportunities around National Cyber Security Awareness Month planning and public-private partnership messaging. I recommend the Director participate in multiple industry events to reinforce FBI's commitment to protecting American businesses and critical infrastructure.

Director Henderson: Agreed. What support do you need for Congressional coordination work?

AD Thompson (Office of Public Affairs): Director, primarily legal and policy expertise. If we could get temporary duty support from Office of General Counsel and Office of Congressional Affairs for 60-90 days during peak oversight season, that would significantly enhance our response capability.

Deputy Director Chang: I'll work with you on personnel coordination. We might be able to detail staff from Field Offices with prior Hill experience.

AGENDA ITEM 5: HUMAN RESOURCES AND WORKFORCE ISSUES

AD Anderson (Human Resources): Director, three items for your awareness:

First, we're 68% through the fiscal year with hiring at 71% of authorized targets - slightly behind pace but manageable given competitive market conditions. The cyber division expansion will require accelerated recruitment and potentially retention bonuses. I'll provide options by next week.

Second, our workforce assessment identified critical gaps in technical expertise - estimated need for 250 additional cyber analysts and forensic specialists over next two years. This exceeds our current training capacity at Quantico, so we'll need to expand partnerships with private sector and academic institutions.

Third, we're implementing new telework policies per updated FBI guidance. This is causing some friction with field office expectations and operational requirements. HR is conducting information sessions and working with division leadership to balance operational needs with workforce flexibility.

Director Henderson: On the technical hiring - what's the timeline if we don't get additional resources?

AD Anderson (Human Resources): Director, current hiring is functional but insufficient for threat demands. We're seeing 15-20% attrition in cyber positions due to private sector competition. If we don't address compensation and career development, we risk losing our most experienced personnel and falling further behind on capability requirements.

Director Henderson: Understood. Let's make this a budget priority. I'll engage with DOJ and OMB on pay flexibility authorities and training expansion.

ADDITIONAL ITEMS DISCUSSED:

- Coordination for upcoming Congressional oversight hearing in April

NEXT MEETING: April 4, 2028 for pre-hearing preparation coordination

Director Henderson: Excellent work, everyone. A few closing thoughts: First, we're entering a critical period with Congressional oversight, budget justification, and international conferences. Our work directly supports not just FBI operations but broader national security interests.

Second, I appreciate the creativity on resource challenges. We'll continue advocating for what we need from DOJ and Congress, but also finding operational solutions with current resources.

Third, remember we're one FBI. The cyber work supports counterterrorism investigations, intelligence enables criminal cases, human resources sustains all our operations. Each division's success contributes to the FBI's mission success.

Thank you for your dedication to protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.

Meeting adjourned at 1030.
