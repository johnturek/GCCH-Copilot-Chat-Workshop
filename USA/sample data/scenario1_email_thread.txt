Subject: RE: Q2 FY28 Quarterly Award Nominations - Alpha Company Issue

SSG Rodriguez,

Alpha Company's CO, CPT Martinez, is requesting an extension until Monday, 25 March due to field training exercise completion delays. Their Soldiers just returned from the field yesterday and need time to compile documentation.

Additionally, Bravo Company has submitted two NCO nominations instead of one - both SFC Thompson and SSG Garcia. Both have exceptional records from the recent deployment. Should we ask them to select one or can we process both?

Also need clarification on the Soldier of the Quarter age limit - one nominee is 19 years old, just checking if there are any restrictions.

V/R,
SPC Johnson

Subject: RE: Q2 FY28 Quarterly Award Nominations - Command Guidance

G-1 Team,

After discussing with Battalion Commander:

1. Alpha Company extension APPROVED until COB 25 March - field ops take priority
2. Bravo Company must select ONE NCO nomination per regulations
3. No age restrictions for Soldier of the Quarter - 19 is acceptable
4. Add requirement: All nominations must include PT scores from last APFT

SSG Rodriguez - ensure all companies are aware of the PT score requirement immediately. This will affect the scoring matrix.

Also, Brigade wants digital submissions only this quarter - no hard copies to be processed.

Good work on staying ahead of this timeline.

Team,

Charlie Company submissions received and reviewed:
- Soldier of the Quarter: SPC Davis, Anthony (300 APFT, expert rifle)

HHC is having issues with their digital submission system. Tech support ticket #2028-0847 submitted to G-6. They may need the hard copy exception.

- Alpha Company: Extension until 25 March
- Bravo Company: Pending single NCO selection
- Charlie Company: Complete
- HHC: Technical issues, pending

V/R,
CPL Stevens
