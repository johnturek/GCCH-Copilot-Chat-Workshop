AGENDA ITEM 1: Q2 FY28 PROMOTION RECOMMENDATIONS

LTC Mitchell: Good afternoon, Soldiers. We're here to review promotion recommendations for Q2 FY28. CPT Williams, please present the Specialist to Corporal recommendations.

CPT Williams: Ma'am, we have eight Specialists eligible for promotion to Corporal. I'll start with the top three recommendations:

1. SPC Anthony Davis, Alpha Company - TIS 2 years, 4 months. Perfect APFT score, expert rifle qualification, completed online college courses. His platoon sergeant reports exceptional leadership during the recent field exercise.

2. SPC Sofia Ramirez, Bravo Company - TIS 2 years, 6 months. 295 APFT, expert rifle, currently squad leader in training. Volunteered for additional duties during deployment prep.

3. SPC Kevin Park, Charlie Company - TIS 2 years, 3 months. 285 APFT, sharpshooter rifle, completed Corporal's Course early. Strong mentorship of junior Soldiers.

SSG Rodriguez: Ma'am, all three have clean records, no negative counselings, and positive feedback from their chain of command.

MSG Thompson: I've worked with SPC Davis personally. His initiative during the logistics exercise was outstanding. He identified a supply chain issue that could have delayed training.

MAJ Chen: What about the remaining five candidates?

CPT Williams: Sir, SPC Jackson from HHC is close but needs improvement on his APFT score - currently at 265. SPC Foster has excellent technical skills but leadership assessment shows need for development. The others are recommended for promotion in Q3 after addressing minor administrative issues.

AGENDA ITEM 2: CORPORAL TO SERGEANT RECOMMENDATIONS

LTC Mitchell: Moving to Sergeant recommendations. MSG Thompson?

MSG Thompson: Ma'am, we have five Corporals eligible. Two standout candidates:

1. CPL Brandon Miller, Alpha Company - TIS 3 years, 8 months. Led a 12-Soldier squad during deployment. 290 APFT, expert rifle, completed Basic Leader Course with distinction. His innovation in maintenance procedures saved the company significant time and resources.

2. CPL Emma Johnson, HHC - TIS 4 years, 1 month. G-1 section leader, managed personnel actions for 400+ Soldiers with zero errors. 285 APFT, expert rifle, pursuing bachelor's degree. Recommended by both company and battalion level leadership.

MSG Garcia: Both Corporals have shown exceptional performance in leadership positions. CPL Miller's tactical knowledge is superior, while CPL Johnson's administrative skills are crucial for operations.

LTC Mitchell: Any concerns about either candidate?

SSG Rodriguez: No concerns, ma'am. Both have consistently exceeded standards and shown growth potential for senior NCO positions.

AGENDA ITEM 3: TIMELINE AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS

CPT Williams: Ma'am, promotion board results need to be submitted to Brigade by March 25th. Ceremonies are scheduled for April 5th during the battalion formation.

All recommended Soldiers have been counseled on expectations and responsibilities of their new ranks. We've prepared promotion orders and updated the promotion tracking system.

LTC Mitchell: Excellent. I want personal congratulations letters prepared for each promoted Soldier, and ensure their families are invited to the ceremony.

AGENDA ITEM 4: PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT DISCUSSIONS

MAJ Chen: We should discuss professional development opportunities for the promoted NCOs. Advanced Leader Course availability and advanced training options.

MSG Thompson: The new Sergeants should be considered for advanced schools - CPL Miller for infantry tactics course, CPL Johnson for personnel administration certification.
