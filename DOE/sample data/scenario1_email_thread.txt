- Case #FSA2028-4601: Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) discharge review
- Case #FSA2028-4623: Borrower Defense to Repayment claim for closed institution

Michael - You're assigned cases FSA2028-4567 and FSA2028-4589. Please prioritize employment certification verification.
Ana - Handle cases FSA2028-4601 and FSA2028-4623. Coordinate with servicers for documentation.

All cases require:
- Completed application forms
- Supporting documentation per program requirements
- Servicer verification records
- Eligibility determination review

Timeline is critical due to the upcoming federal holiday on March 25. Any processing conflicts, contact me immediately.

Subject: RE: Priority Student Aid Cases - Case FSA2028-4589 Documentation Issue

Ms. Johnson,

Case FSA2028-4589 (IDR recertification) has incomplete documentation. The borrower, James Anderson, submitted income verification but is missing:
- Qualifying payment count verification from servicer
- Tax return transcript for income verification (FAFSA data incomplete)
- Employer certification for qualifying employment periods

I contacted the borrower via email requesting documents by COB March 20. However, they indicated difficulty obtaining servicer records until March 23 due to servicer processing delays.

Should we:
1. Schedule determination for March 26 (after servicer confirms)?
2. Request expedited documentation from the servicer?
3. Accept alternative proof of qualifying payments?

Also, case FSA2028-4567 (PSLF) has an employment certification delay. The borrower works for multiple qualifying employers and needs verification from each. Estimated completion: March 21, which meets our deadline but is cutting it close.

Question: For the PSLF case, the borrower requested expedited processing due to retirement date. Is this eligible under our priority processing criteria?

Respectfully,
Michael Chen, GS-9
Program Specialist

Subject: RE: Priority Student Aid Cases - Guidance and Approvals

Student Aid Team,

After reviewing the cases with the Deputy Assistant Secretary:

1. Case FSA2028-4589 (Anderson IDR recertification): APPROVED for March 26 determination. Accept servicer preliminary payment count pending final verification. Verify with NSLDS if needed.

2. Case FSA2028-4567 (PSLF expedited): APPROVED for priority processing coordination with servicer. This qualifies under retirement-related priority criteria per recent Department guidance. Schedule determination March 22 pending employment certification.

3. All applications must include fraud prevention review per recent program integrity memo ED-2028-PI-003 - additional scrutiny on income documentation.

Michael - Work with servicer on accelerated employment verification for the PSLF applicant. Copy me on the status update by COB today.

Ana - Send me update on the TPD and Borrower Defense cases by noon. We need to ensure no delays given the disability circumstances of the TPD case.

Also, reminder: Division received notice of increased inquiry volumes due to recent policy announcements. We need to explore options for additional case processing capacity. Sarah, let's discuss resource allocation in our 1400 meeting today.

Well done on managing the workload during this busy period.
