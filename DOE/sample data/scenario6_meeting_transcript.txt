AGENDA ITEM 1: DEPARTMENT PRIORITIES - Q2 2028

Secretary Henderson: Good morning, everyone. Let's begin with program priorities for the quarter. Jennifer, please start with K-12 updates.

Assistant Secretary Martinez: Madam Secretary, we're tracking three major developments. First, the state accountability plan review cycle is nearing completion. We've approved 38 state plans and have 12 remaining in revision status. Most common issues are around English learner accountability and school improvement identification criteria.

Second, Title I funding for FY2029 is in conference committee. Current proposals range from $18.2B to $19.1B. We need to prepare for either outcome with guidance adjustments.

Third, the evidence-based intervention requirement under ESSA is showing mixed implementation. About 60% of states report capacity challenges. We're planning a technical assistance initiative with IES to address this.

Deputy Secretary Chang: On the evidence-based requirements - how does this impact our monitoring priorities for the year?

Assistant Secretary Martinez: Sir, it's creating additional work. States are requesting more guidance on what qualifies as evidence-based, and we're seeing variation in how tier ratings are being applied. We'll need to issue clarifying guidance by June to ensure consistent implementation.

COO Kim: From the FSA perspective, we're also seeing implications for student aid programs. Institutions receiving Title IV funds need to demonstrate program effectiveness, and there's increasing overlap between K-12 evidence requirements and higher ed accountability.

Secretary Henderson: What's our recommendation on coordination between offices?

COO Kim: Madam Secretary, I recommend we establish a cross-office working group on evidence-based policy. This ensures consistent messaging to states, institutions, and the public about what evidence means across the education continuum.

AGENDA ITEM 2: FEDERAL STUDENT AID OPERATIONS

COO Kim: Ma'am, FSA is managing significant volume increases. We're processing 15% more FAFSA applications than this time last year - primarily driven by the new streamlined application and increased Pell Grant maximum.

Current processing time for income-driven repayment applications is 32 days, which is within our service standards but drawing concerns from borrower advocates. We've received three Congressional inquiries in the past month about processing delays.

Deputy Secretary Chang: What's driving the workload? Staffing or system constraints?

COO Kim: Both, sir. We're down 150 positions from our authorized level due to the hiring pause, and the new FAFSA simplification required system updates that are still being optimized. Additionally, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program continues to generate high volumes of applications.

Assistant Secretary Williams: We've submitted staffing waiver requests for critical FSA positions, but OMB hasn't approved them yet. In the interim, I recommend we explore contractor support for routine processing tasks.

Secretary Henderson: Approved. Robert, coordinate with David on the contract options. Also, I want a response prepared for the Congressional inquiries emphasizing our service improvements while explaining the volume challenges. Lisa, work with Robert on public messaging.

AGENDA ITEM 3: CIVIL RIGHTS AND EQUITY MONITORING

Assistant Secretary Johnson: Ma'am, the civil rights environment remains active with ongoing compliance reviews across multiple issue areas. Key updates:

First, we completed 47 Title VI investigations this quarter with 12 finding compliance concerns. Most issues relate to discipline disparities and English learner services. We're seeing improved resolution rates with our new technical assistance approach.

Second, Title IX enforcement continues to generate significant stakeholder engagement. New regulations take effect in August, and we're conducting training for institutions and OCR staff.

Third, we've identified concerning patterns in special education identification rates in several states. This may require coordinated action between OCR and OSERS.

Secretary Henderson: Are we confident in our enforcement capacity for the new Title IX implementation?

Assistant Secretary Johnson: Yes, Ma'am. We've conducted tabletop exercises with regional offices and institutional partners. Our procedures are solid. I recommend we increase proactive outreach to institutions in the coming months to prevent compliance issues rather than only responding reactively.

AGENDA ITEM 4: COMMUNICATIONS AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Assistant Secretary Thompson: Madam Secretary, we've had productive engagement on key initiatives. Highlights:

Our social media engagement increased 28% this quarter - particularly strong performance on student aid information and career technical education content. The Secretary's recent school visits generated significant positive coverage.

However, we're also tracking concerning misinformation trends. Coordinated campaigns are spreading false information about student loan forgiveness programs and FAFSA requirements. We're working with platform companies and the FTC to address these, but it's resource-intensive.

Looking ahead, we have opportunities around the National Blue Ribbon Schools announcements in June. I recommend the Secretary participate in multiple recognition events to reinforce the Department's support for educational excellence.

Secretary Henderson: Agreed. What support do you need for counter-misinformation work?

Assistant Secretary Thompson: Ma'am, primarily digital communications capacity. If we could get additional positions approved for our digital team for the next 6-12 months, that would significantly enhance our capability.

Deputy Secretary Chang: I'll work with you on a staffing request. We might be able to coordinate with FSA's communications team for shared resources.

AGENDA ITEM 5: MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET ISSUES

Assistant Secretary Williams: Madam Secretary, three items for your awareness:

First, we're 68% through the fiscal year budget with 73% obligated - slightly ahead of pace. The FSA operations expansion will require reprogramming funds from other areas. I'll provide options by next week.

Second, our facility assessment identified needed upgrades to the LBJ Building HVAC system - estimated $3.2 million. This exceeds our maintenance budget authority, so we'll need to request supplemental from GSA.

Third, we're implementing new telework policies per the Administration's updated guidance. This is causing some adjustment challenges with staff expectations. HR is conducting information sessions to manage the transition.

Secretary Henderson: On the HVAC - what's the timeline if we don't get supplemental funding?

Assistant Secretary Williams: Ma'am, the system is functional but inefficient. We're seeing 25% higher energy costs and reliability concerns. If we defer, we risk a major failure that could disrupt headquarters operations.

Secretary Henderson: Understood. Let's make the GSA request a priority. I'll engage with OMB on the urgency.

ADDITIONAL ITEMS DISCUSSED:

- Coordination for upcoming Congressional hearings on reauthorization
- State education agency engagement on ESSA implementation
- National education summit planning

1. OESE: Draft guidance on evidence-based intervention standards for states - Due: March 25

NEXT MEETING: April 4, 2028 for Congressional hearing preparation

Secretary Henderson: Excellent work, everyone. A few closing thoughts: First, we're entering a critical period with Congressional hearings, reauthorization discussions, and major program implementation deadlines. Our work directly supports American students from pre-K through postsecondary.

Second, I appreciate the creativity on resource challenges. We'll continue advocating for what we need, but also finding solutions with what we have.

Third, remember we're a team. Elementary and secondary work supports student aid transitions, civil rights enforcement ensures all students benefit, communications helps the public understand our mission. Each office's success contributes to Department success.

Thank you for your dedication to American education.

Meeting adjourned at 1030.
